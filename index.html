<a name="Home" class="anchor" ><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Webtechnology 2.</h3>

<p>During this course, we will be learnig advanced JavaScript-techniques, such as creating our own framework to work with. We got introduced to GitHub, a free hosting service on which 
projects can be shared and worked on. We also had a look at some new CSS features: Animations, translations and transformations. Next up we saw how to use ajax to interact with API's to acquire certain information and how to develop realtime apps with the help of Node.js and web sockets. To make coding in CSS even easier, we saw how to implement pre-processors, like SASS, which goes hand in hand with a couple of CSS libraries, e.g. Bourbon and Compass.  </p>

<h3>
<a name="GitHub" class="anchor" ><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>GitHub</h3>

<p>In the fist lesson, we were introduced to GitHub, a free online hosting service that enables you to share your projects and contribute to other people's projects. GitHub also provides both a gui and a terminal, so that you are able to clone your online project repository to a locale folder, where you can modify your files, create branches and upload them back to your GitHub account through some easy git commands.</p>
<pre><code>
	Basic git commands:<br />
    $git add *filename*<br />
    $git commit -m "insert comment"<br />
    $git push <br />
    $git branch
</code></pre>
<p>
	As exercise, we had to work in teams of 4 persons creating a GitHub repository on which 4 food recipes had to be uploaded. Each team-member had to create his own recipe-page and commit it to the online repository.<br />
    <a href="https://github.com/larspeeters/Kapsalon" >Recipe exercise</a>
</p>
<p>
	Personally, I had never heard of GitHub or its uses. After this lesson I acknowledged its practical uses and after some practice, I got the hang of using the GIT terminal. This is mainly because it resembles the terminal syntax used in Linux.
</p>
<h3>
<a name="CSS" class="anchor" ><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>CSS animations</h3>

<p>
	The second lesson was about the use of animations on a website. We learned how animations were created by CSS transformations which allowed us to translate, scale, rotate... the desired object.  This can make your website looking a bit more interactive than usual.
</p>
<p>
	The exercise for this lesson contained 2 animations. For the first one, we had to create a clickable circle. When the circle was clicked on, 3 other circles had to appear and move to the left, to the right and diagonally. The second animation had to contain a sort of login screen with three user accounts and a banner. The account images had to scaled when you hovered above it and the bannertext had to move from left to right, while the banner itself had to rotate on the x-scale.<br />
    <a href="https://github.com/larspeeters/larspeeters.github.io/tree/master/css-animations" >Animations exercise</a>    
</p>

<p>
	I had already learned about some animation tricks you could use in CSS, but not all were familiar to me. Most of 3D animations were kind of new to me, but were very fun to work with and offer
    some pretty cool effects to implement on a website.
</p>

<h3>
<a name="AdvancedJS" class="anchor" ><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Advanced JavaScript</h3>

<p>
	In the next lesson, we got introduced to some advanced JavaScript by creating and implementing our own framework. This way we got a basic tutorial of how a frameworks and libraries, like jQuery, can be developped and used for more efficient coding.
</p>
<p>
	This week's exercise was to build a small todo-app which would operate on a personal made framework. The framework had to contain a function which allowed to change the color of a given tag, class or id. Furthermore, there had to be a function which would call upon the other function whenever the user had clicked one of the listitems. This could be done by using an addEventListener-method. <br />
    <a href="https://github.com/larspeeters/larspeeters.github.io/tree/master/AdvancedJS" >Todo-app</a>    
</p>
<p>
	Creating your very own framework or librarie using JavaScript was something completely new to me. But it was interesting to see how something like jQuery is build up and is efficient to use. 
    It was fun creating my own framework and developping some handy functions to interact with it.
</p>
<h3>
<a name="API" class="anchor" ><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>To API, or not to API?</h3>

<p>
	During this lesson we learned how to work with API's. API's use JSON-files (JavaScript Object Notations) which contain data about a certain object, like weather conditions, nearest toilets, nearest hospitals,... these datasets can be retrieved using ajax-calls in jQuery. After a succesful retrieval, the data can be used in the app you are developping. We also came across localStorage, which is a client-side version of sessions, which we could use to store our datasets in.
</p>
<p>
	As an exercise, we had to create a weather app in which we used a certain weather API to retrieve data about the current weather conditions. This API also allowed us to display the weather conditions for the next hours and days. We also had to implement some text input, so that we were able to acquire weather conditions for different locations. <br />
    <a href="https://github.com/larspeeters/larspeeters.github.io/tree/master/App" >Weather app</a> 
</p>
<p>
	I had fun experimenting with the weather API. I didn't have any experience using ajax-calls to retrieve JSON-files and was a bit astonished about what kind of data it contained and how useful it can be to use in certain web or mobile apps. The use of localStorage was also quite new to me, but since it resembles the php session-variables, I got the hang of it pretty fast.
</p>
<h3>
<a name="Node" class="anchor" ><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Node.js &amp; web sockets</h3>

<p>

</p>
<h3>
<a name="Sass" class="anchor" ><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Let's git Sass(y)!</h3>
<p>
	This lesson was about using pre-processors to make coding in CSS even more easier. We got to work with Sass, but there are other frameworks like Less and Stylus. By using one of these pre-processors, you're able to code more dynamically and organized by creating variables, seperate files... The installation of Sass also required the installation of Ruby, after which we could start experimenting. And if you want to go even further, there are some handy frameworks, like Bourbon and Compass, which makes coding in Sass even easier by removing the use of prefixes and other things.
</p>
<p>
	I'm glad we had this lesson about pre-processors, because it looks really handy to use when coding CSS. I've had times where I had written more than 100 lines of CSS and it became difficult to keep it a bit organized. But by using this, it may seem like those days are over.
